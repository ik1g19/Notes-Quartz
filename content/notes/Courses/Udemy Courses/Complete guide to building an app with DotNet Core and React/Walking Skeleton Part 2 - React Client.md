# Creating the React Project

Rather than using HTML or CSS to build our web pages, we will build them using React components

We will be using Vite as opposed to NextJS etc... as the framework to create the React project

Using npm you can create a vite project using

```
npm create vite@latest
```

First you will be prompted to enter a vite project name

Then you will be prompted to select a framework for this project, which in this case will be React

You will then be prompted to choose a variant, which in this case will be using TypeScript and **S**peedy **W**eb **C**ompiler

Then `cd ./client-app` and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed

Start the Vite-React application using:

```
npm run dev
```

It will start on localhost:5173 by default
