In Java, the `transient` keyword is used as a modifier for instance variables (fields) to indicate that they should **not be serialized** when an object is being serialized.

>[!What is Serialization?]
>Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can then be stored to a file, sent over a network, or transferred in any way. Deserialization is the reverse process: converting the byte stream back into an object.

## Role of `transient`

When an object is serialized, all of its fields are by default included in the serialization process. However, there may be certain fields that you donâ€™t want to serialize (for example, sensitive information like passwords, or fields that are derived and can be recalculated after deserialization). In such cases, you can mark those fields with the `transient` modifier, and Java will skip them during serialization
