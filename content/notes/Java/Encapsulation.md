## Why Encapsulation?

- Better control of class attributes and methods
- Class attributes can be made **read-only** (if you only use the `get` method), or **write-only** (if you only use the `set` method)
- Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
- Increased security of data
