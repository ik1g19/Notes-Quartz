# Max and Min

The `max(_x_,_y_)` function can be used to find the highest value of _x_ and _y_:

```c++
cout << max(5, 10);  
```

And the `min(_x_,_y_)` function can be used to find the lowest value of _x_ and _y_:

```c++
cout << min(5, 10);
```

# `<cmath>`

Other functions, such as `sqrt` (square root), `round` (rounds a number) and `log` (natural logarithm), can be found in the `<cmath>` header file:

```c++
// Include the cmath library  
#include <cmath>  
  
cout << sqrt(64);  
cout << round(2.6);  
cout << log(2);
```
