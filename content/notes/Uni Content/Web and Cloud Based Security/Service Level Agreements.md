# Service Level Agreements

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

The part of a contract which defines exactly what services a service provider will provide and the required level or standard for those services.

## SLA Objectives

- Improve performance
- Save costs
- Provide access to technologies
- Provide access to skills

## Description of the Services

- The SLA should include a detailed description of the services.
- Each individual service should be defined.

## Performance Standards

- In practice, it may be impossible, unnecessary or very expensive to achieve performance standards at the highest level at the request of a customer.
- The service provider may argue that service levels should be set deliberately low in order to guarantee that the service can be delivered at a competitive price.

## Compensation/Service Credits

- Often achieved through the inclusion of a service credit regime. Where the service provider fails to achieve the agreed performance standards, the service provider will pay or credit the customer an agreed amount, which should act as incentive for improved performance.
- For the SLA to have any "bite", failure to achieve service levels needs to have a financial consequence for the service provider.

## Critical Failure

Solution to critical failure includes:
- A right for service credit
- A right to sue for damages
- A right for the customer to terminate the agreement if service delivery becomes unacceptably bad.

## Service

A means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs and risks.

## Elements of a Good SLA

- Performance standards
- Overall objectives
- Description of the services
- Compensation/Service credits
- Critical failure
