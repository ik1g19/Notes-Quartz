# Internal Information

## Look for

- How does the application and framework handle error reporting
- How does the application handle unexpected errors and faults

## Think about

- Separating your development and live environment
- Do you want to throw away the error information or keep it somewhere

## How to fix

- Handle errors and faults correctly, don't make error information public
