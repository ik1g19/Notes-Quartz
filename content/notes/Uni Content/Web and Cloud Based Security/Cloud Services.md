# Cloud Services

## Security By Design

The implementation of multiple security measures to protect the most valuable resource on your network

### Involves

1. Network
2. Code
3. People
 
## Security Myths

1. The cloud is secure by design
2. The cloud is unsecure by design
3. Someone else's platform means its someone else's problem
 
## Security Terms

1. Monitoring practises↔Storage analytics and security logs
2. Identify/Access control↔RBAC, MFA and password policies
3. Network security↔VPNs and network security groups
4. Store security↔Data encryption, client-side encryption and key vaults
 
## On Premises Computing vs. Cloud Computing

1. Provisions→Manually provisioned vs. Self-provisioned
2. Hardware→Dedicated hardware vs. Shared hardware
3. Capacity→Fixed capacity vs. Elastic capacity 
4. Expenses→Capital & operational expenses vs. Operational expenses
5. Managed by→Managed via sysadmins vs. Managed via APIs
 
## The Five Essential Characteristic of Cloud Computing

1. On-demand self-service
2. Share/pooled resources
3. Broad network access
4. Scalable and elastic
5. Metered by use
 
## Cloud Benefits

1. Cost efficiencies
	- Zero up front captial costs
	- Scale as system grows
2. Time efficiencies
	- Create virtual resources instead of physical
	- Offers substantial elasticity and scalability
3. Power efficiencies
	- Will be able to easy measure power consumption use by algorithms
4. Improved process control
	- Quick recovery
5. Improved security
6. "Unlimited" capacity
