# Application Logic

## Look for

- Is there application logic the users can affect through user input

## Think about

- How to ensure the integrity of any multi-step processes or functions or actions
- How can you protect the logic

## How to fix

- Keep state server-side
- Ensure unexpected actions cannot have unexpected consequences
- Individually check if each input is invalid, so that the logic can only be followed if every single input is valid
