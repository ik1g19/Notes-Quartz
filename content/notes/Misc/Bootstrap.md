#bootstrap

**Bootstrap** is a popular open-source front-end framework designed for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. Created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, it simplifies the web development process by providing a collection of reusable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. This framework allows developers to create visually appealing and functional web applications without extensive coding.

## Key Features:

- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap's grid system enables automatic adjustment of layouts based on screen size, ensuring optimal viewing experiences across devices[](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/bootstrap)[](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-bootstrap-a-beginners-guide/).
- **Predefined Components**: It includes various UI components like buttons, forms, modals, and navigation bars, which can be easily integrated into projects[](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_bootstrap.asp).
- **Customizability**: Although Bootstrap has a standard design, developers can customize styles to fit their specific needs[](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-bootstrap-a-beginners-guide/).
- **JavaScript Plugins**: Bootstrap offers numerous jQuery plugins that enhance interactivity, such as carousels and tooltips[](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-bootstrap-a-beginners-guide/).
